#Refining Selections

Notes: learn all about different ways of narrowing our selections or refining our selections, or at least manipulating them in some way to do things like order or sort our results, or only get unique or distinct results to limit the number of results we get. These are different things that we can add on to our queries to change how our selections behave.

```ts
INSERT INTO books
    (title, author_fname, author_lname, released_year, stock_quantity, pages)
    VALUES ('10% Happier', 'Dan', 'Harris', 2014, 29, 256),
           ('fake_book', 'Freida', 'Harris', 2001, 287, 428),
           ('Lincoln In The Bardo', 'George', 'Saunders', 2017, 1000, 367);

```
