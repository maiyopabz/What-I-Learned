# Hosting Solution

`Localhost` would be the first option to get it to be live for testing but not shared out the public.

`Traditional Web Hosting:` Pre Package hosting such as Bluehost , GoDaddy manage by hosting company that reuires a fixed Monthly/Yearly Plan.

`Shared Hosting Package:`

- > Hosting company allocates a certain amount of resource to your website.
- > Resource allocation based on subscription Plan.
- > Very Easy to use. Hosting Company takes care of all managment and configuration.

`Dedicated Hosting:`

- > All server resources decicated to your Web Application.
- > Server are Powerful.
- > More Bandwidth.
- > Full control over Managed.
- > Custom Server Hardware Configuration.

`Virtual Private Server (VPS):`

- > Much better resource allocation than shared hosting.
- > Few Sites on Single Server.
- > Servers are Powerful.
- > More Bandwidth.
- > Fair Control over Configuration.
- > Self-Managed or Managed.
- > Restricted to existing Hardware.

The number of sites sharing the system is significantly less than with shared hosting.
`Virtual private server` do not have the same flexibility as `dedicated hosting` as far as hardware upgrades.

`Cloud Hosting:`

- > Revolutionary Technology.
- > Very Flexible.
- > Full Control.
- > Highly Scalable.
- > Almost Zero Downtime.
- > Per Second/ Hour Billing.
- > Pay Only for what yoo Use
- > Hardware is Scalable (Virttually)

To understand how cloud hosting differs from traditional hosting, let's first take a look at the downsides of traditional Web hosting.

With the traditional hosting packages we explored, you probably noticed that the packages available were very standardized, meaning you pay a fixed monthly cost and are allocated a certain amount of resource per month.

Including CPU storage and bandwidth of the server.

If we used anything less than this allocation, we still pay the same fixed monthly cost.

If we went over our usage allowance, we pay a costly over usage fee.

Another issue was the jump from the best shared hosting package to a virtual package was quite steep.

There was no solution available if you needed more resources than the shared hosting could offer, but

not quite as much as virtual hosting solutions.

If our website was very resource intensive, we could opt for a dedicated server as powerful as the dedicated server was, what if we needed even more CPU, RAM and storage space than the existing hardware configuration offered?

We would need to physically keep adding and upgrading physical hardware components to make it more challenging, the server would be stored in a data center so an onsite technician would be required to do the work.

This could incur significant costs and even more importantly, your website would be down for a period of time unless a backup server would was created.

`Cloud hosting` provides an efficient solution to all these issues.

The key difference is the way in which resources from a cloud computing network can be utilized versus traditional hosting.

`Cloud servers` allow users, users to create virtual machines and extract as much resource from the cloud is needed.

The `cloud` itself can be infinitely scaled to meet the needs of the applications it hosts.

This means you can tap into the `cloud`and create a virtual server that best suits the needs and resource requirements of your website or application.

Rather than being hosted on a single instance of a physical server, as with traditional hosting.

The website is hosted on a virtual partition, which draws its system resources from an extensive network of underlying physical servers.

`Cloud hosting features, utility style costing, meaning you only pay for what you use.`
