# Benefits of Cloud Computing.

`Intro to cloud computing`

- > The ability to provision resource on demand is achieved through "Virtualiztion".
- > `Virtualization:` The process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the acutal hardware.

`Core Advantage can be defined by five categories:`

- > Greater cost efficiency.
- > Imporved ability, faster time to market.
- > Greater scalability and elasticity.
- > Improved reliability and business continuity.
- > Improved performance and security.

`Important Note:`

" With a click of a button System Administrators are now able to deploy virtual computing instances that can easily handle the infrastructure need of small, medium, and enterprise level application. "

# There are 3 main type of cloud service models.

1. `Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)`
2. `Platform as a service (PaaS)`
3. `Software as a service (SaaS)`

//NOTE
    - > With traditional infrastructure, the organization is responsible for all IT services assets.
    - > This includes system hardware, software, applications, development tools, and administration.
    - > Organization would also purchase resources, install them, and manage them within their own data center.
```

- > With `Cloud` computing, the cloud service provides customers with console access to deploy resources through a web-based platform.

- > `Cloud` provider bills customer (cloud tenat) a specified amount based on resource consumption, on a pay-as-you-go basis.

"Resources employed will depend on an organizations need. provisioned assets can be grouped into one or more of three service models.
This includes: `IaaS`, `PaaS`, and `SaaS`."
