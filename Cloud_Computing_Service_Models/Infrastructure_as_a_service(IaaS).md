# Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

- > Customer can provision an infinite amount of computing resources
- > All resources managed bu a third party.
- > Cloud provider host, manages, and maintains all hardware and computing resources throughout it's globally distributed data centers.

Under infrastructure as a service, the cloud service provider hosts, manages and maintains all the hardware and computing resources that are available within a number of data centers, typically dispersed among several geographic regions.

- > IaaS customers can provision computer resources by deploying virtual instances which are hosted on shared or dedicated phyiscal resources.
- > Computer resources extracted from shared physical resources are managed through virtualization.

<strong>Note:</strong>

The most remarkable feature of IaaS platforms is the ease, speed and efficiency in which compute, storage and network resources can be deployed.

Most cloud service providers offer web based graphical dashboards or application programming interfaces, also known as APIs, where by just about any compute resource can be provisioned almost instantaneously
through the click of a button.

Due to the flexibility in control in building out computing resources offered by IaaS platforms, there are a number of benefits of IaaS over traditional on premises infrastructure.

- > This includes the ability to easily provision and scale on demand computing resources based on spikes or troughs in traffic.

- > The ability to eliminate the high upfront and overhead costs associated with purchasing and maintaining on premises data centres.

- > Eliminating the risk of network and resource outages that can occur in on premises data centers resulting from underestimating capacity requirements.

- > Improving service availability and helping to minimise downtime through data redundancy.

Since most cloud service providers offer storage and backup servers across a broad range of geographic areas, organizations benefit from less downtime caused by power outages and physical disasters.

The cross-regional nature of cloud data centres also results in lower latency and higher network performance. Organisations are able to deliver content from servers that are in close proximity to end users.

Cloud service providers offer some of the highest levels of onsite security, including data encryption and round the clock monitoring of its network and security protocols.

Since data center management is the core business function of a cloud service provider, they can focus exclusively on ensuring the physical architecture of their system is equipped with the latest hardware and firmware.

<strong>Ecommerce:</strong>

Online retail businesses benefit tremendously from the core benefits of IaaS.

For example, most ecommerce sites start with a small catalog of products and little to no traffic.

As the sites grow in popularity, they incrementally increase their product offerings and likewise gradually require increases in computing, storage and network resources.

Furthermore, due to the seasonal nature of retail product demand, e-commerce sites often see significant spikes in traffic during certain months of the year.

The flexibility of IaaS cloud services makes them a perfect candidate for e-commerce businesses that require flexible on demand, resource scalability to keep up with business growth and traffic fluctuations.

<strong>Software Development/Testing:</strong>

Often times organizations require temporary computing, storage and network resources to test applications or develop new software.

It can be cumbersome and costly to set up the infrastructure needed for this purpose on premises.

Infrastructure is a service entirely eliminates the need to purchase, store and maintain hardware on site.

Organisations can use IaaS cloud platforms to deploy the resources they need on demand while only paying for the resources they use based on an efficient pay as you go model.

The third important use case is artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.
A.I. and Iot applications generally process extremely large volumes of data.

IaaS cloud services can easily provision the data storage and computing resources required for these use cases.

Facilitating the infrastructure for AI and Iot projects on premises would likely be impossible for most

small to medium sized businesses due to the budgetary constraints and other resource limitations.

<strong>Disaster recovery/Data Storage:</strong>

Another very common use case for IaaS is data storage, data backups and disaster recovery.

Since cloud service providers offer a geographically dispersed I.T infrastructure, they can easily store data in multiple locations.

Since data redundancy is an integral part of ensuring data integrity, IaaS offers a perfect solution for organisations looking to safely and securely store important data in different parts of the world to safeguard against network or data centre outages.

Another key advantage to using IaaS cloud services for storage is the scalability and flexibility of their storage services.

Cloud providers can provision a nearly infinite amount of storage capacity on a utility style billing model.
