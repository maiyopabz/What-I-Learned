#Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- > The cloud service provider provisions a larger portion of the I.T. workload than under the IaaS model.

- > In addition to managing the physical infrastructure, a PaaS cloud platform will also maintain the software, which includes the operating system, middleware, runtime development tools, virtualization and any necessary frameworks.

- > This includes all services related to software and hardware security upgrades and data storage and backups.

- > Similar to IaaS platforms, all resources provisioned under the PaaS model are done so over the internet using a graphical user interface.

- > As defined by IBM as cloud service providers are often used by development teams in operations or DevOps teams to collaborate on every aspect of the application development lifecycle from coding, integration,testing, delivery, deployment and feedback.

There are several well known PaaS solutions used throughout the development industry, including:

- > Google App Engine.
- > Elastic Beanstalk.
- > OpenShift.
- > Heroku Oracle.
- > Cloud and Cloud.
- > Wave.

Similar to the IaaS model. `PaaS has several benefits` for an application deployment.

Will start with flexibility and scalability.

As with IaaS, `PaaS` resources can be rapidly scaled to add `computational` storage and `network capacity` during peak times. Developers and other personnel can also easily log into the `PaaS` platform and collaborate on application workloads using shared software development environments.

`The second benefit is speed to market.`

PaaS platforms can rapidly provision various deployment environments for the purpose of testing and production.

These preset deployment configurations are both versatile and cost effective. They also operate on state of the art data centers, hardware and operating systems.

`The third key benefit is that PR services are managed in low risk.`

PaaS service models simplify the provisioning of managed resources.

Operational tools enable DevOps teams to minimise unnecessary overhead on development teams under this service model.

System updates, infrastructure management, security patches and several other administrative tasks are offloaded onto the cloud service provider.

Development teams also benefit from access to the most up to date range of resources across the application stack.This includes the latest operating systems, scripting languages and state of the art hardware.

`DevOps`

One of the most common use cases for PaaS solutions is collaborative DevOps teams, where communication is at the heart of each project. PaaS supports the entire application development lifecycle right through to the deployment phase.

`Another common use case is API development in management.`

Application programming, interfaces or APIs can be developed, executed and tested securely.
PaaS enables effective data sharing frameworks to ensure integration between applications.

`This includes end to end API management.`
`Data management and analytics.`

Big data is undoubtedly the main reason why organisations continue to shift operations to the cloud. PaaS facilitates the deployment of scalable on demand solutions for creating, administering and maintaining enterprise level databases.

`This unique feature makes PaaS the perfect solution for processing and analyzing business data to identify trends, make predictions, and make accurate, data driven decisions.`

Another important use case is the Internet of Things or `Iot`.

`PaaS` is a key technology for the `Iot` movement, which facilitates data exchange between devices and systems over the Internet and other communication networks.

`Iot` is an emerging trend, but growing rapidly.

Statista reports that the number of `Iot` devices worldwide is expected to nearly triple from 8.74 billion in 2020 to more than 25.4 billion `Iot` devices in 2030.

`PaaS` supports a number of languages used to develop `Iot` applications, including Java, Python and Swift.

`PaaS` also provides an infrastructure for real time processing of `Iot` device data.
